Using Roboflow API for automated cell counting in microscopic images.

1. Organize ground truth annotations into a Map for easier filtering.
2. Read and encodes each image file into base64, and sends to Roboflow API for detection.
3. Store predicted cell counts and calculates ground truth counts post-processing.
4. Output ground truth and predicted counts for comparison.

HOW TO TEST:

Open terminal and navigate to the `script.js` file directory and run `node script.js`
