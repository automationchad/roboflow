              For ten years, we’ve been perfecting the art of running a
              “7-Figure Zen” business. Here you’ll learn: Who we help, What we
              do, our Philosophy, Story, and Team members.
            </p>

              <h3>Who we help</h3>
              <p>
                We help coaches, consultants, course creators, agencies, and
                experts (basically, anybody who sells advice). We only work with
                founders who are experts at their craft, with existing
                businesses making at least $10,000 /month. These businesses have
                all the raw materials necessary for 7-figure profits but they
                lack the structures, systems, teams, tools, and guidance on how
                to get there.
              </p>
              <h3>What do we do</h3>
              <p>
                We help these founders achieve “7-Figure Zen” — a business that
                makes $100k+ /month profit, with 1-2 products, 2-3 remote staff,
                happy clients, and a chill lifestyle. We do this through our two
                training programs: Wetube and Quantum . Our programs aim to
                maximize: Profits, client results, and founder happiness. Our
                programs aim to minimize: Complexity, costs, headcount, and
                stress.
              </p>
              <h3>Our philosophy</h3>
              <p>
                "7-Figure Zen" is the perfect balance between profit, client
                results, and founder happiness. To achieve this balance, we
                follow a philosophy built on six core principles:
